Hello everyone and thank you for checking out this little project. This API is for reading data and converting it from the weekly backup files sent by your Solarlog.

As of now ther is not much implemented but I plan to improve and expand it as time goes on. 

The goal is to keep a modular way to easily read and manipulate the data to be able to work with it in other projects. I plan to release a little gui too to display information, but there will definetly be some form of graph implemented in this API. stay tuned!

If you want to improve some functions or contribute feel free to do so, also feel free to use this project in any way that could help you personally.




Greetings, Chaosmelone9
